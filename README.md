# Beelzebul-AI
> Python, OpenAI, gTTS, code where ChatGPT assisted. Created by SimpCast Productions

# Installing Dependencies
> All you need is basically what's being said in the first lines of code that says "import"

`pip install gTTS`, `pip install FFmpeg`, `pip install discord.py`, `pip install openai`

# Setup instructions
1. MAKE SURE PYTHON IS INSTALLED ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE
2. Get your OpenAI API key from their website and paste it on the `openai.api_key`'s value.
3. Get your Discord Bot Token from the Discord Developer Portal and post it on the `os.environ['BOT KEY']`'s value.
4. Install your Dependencies
5. Open an IDE(VsCode) or `cmd` and `cd <directory where you downloaded file>`
5. `py main.py`

# Features
1. Beelzebul-AI sends messages exactly like the actual person.
2. If you interact with Beelzebul-AI while in VC, she will respend with a text response, and a TTS one.
3. She's a little confused, but she got the spirit.
4. **ATOMIC HEART?!?!?!**

### Note: I advise running this on your local machine. Replit hates large repositories like ffmpeg, and the TTS Feature will not work.
